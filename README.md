## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 
This program defines a function named factorial that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer input by the user. The factorial is computed using a for loop that multiplies all integers from 1 up to the input number n, accumulating the product in a variable named result. The function returns this product as the factorial of the number. Finally, the program reads an integer from user input, calls the factorial function, and prints the computed factorial value. The factorial of a number n is mathematically defined as n!=1×2×⋯×n, with 0!=1 by definition.

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
This program asks the user to input a number (which can be a float). It then uses Python’s built-in math module to compute three mathematical values for the input number:
The square root using math.sqrt().
The natural logarithm (log base e) using math.log().
The sine of the number (interpreted as radians) using math.sin().
Each computed value is displayed separately with descriptive print statements. This program leverages standard math library functions to perform common mathematical operations on user input, demonstrating usage of basic mathematical computations in Python.
